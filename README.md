## Configuration

See config example.   The config.json may be placed in /etc/alarmpi, .alarmpi in your $HOME directory, or in the current working directory

### Extra settings

```
   "AppName": "alarmpi",
   "HttpActionTimeout": "15s",
   "Chip": "gpiochip0"
```

## Install

Copy binary to a suitable location, service file included for linux/raspi

 
### Pin Entries

The configuration has a top level "Pins" each top level contains a association to a GPIO pin and within each block  you have the following labels

```
	"Pins":{
		"GPIO16":{
    		"Label": "Contact 1",
    		"Type": "http",
			"Open": "http://example.com/on",
			"Closed": "example.com/off"
		},
```

#### Label

The label to be presented i.e Hallway, Front Door, etc.

#### Type

The type of event to trigger on, options are "http" for making a HTTP GET request or "exec" for executing a local program

#### Http 

Http will execute the url provided in the "Open" and "Close fields"

#### Exec

Exec will execute a script named in "Open" or Closed and pass in the following arguments


* Name: gpio16
* State: open|closed
* Label: Front Door

It will essentially execute as if you were running the following

```
./callback_script.sh gpio16 open "Front Door"
```
